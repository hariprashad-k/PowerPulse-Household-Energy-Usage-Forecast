# PowerPulse-Household-Energy-Usage-Forecast having household electric data which eat date and time recorded reading and problem is to find out the Global active power, It is Regresiion model at first we have importated all the needed libaries and load the data in dataframe then check null values and defined them using linear method. Checked all the datatypes of the columns and converted the date and Time to DATATIME dtyoe and saperated them to month day_name and day. THen done EDA for month ,day ,date and then finded correlations. In this we have used 5 different types of Regression model and perforamed their data using train_test_split. All the the model performed weel and for Decision Tree model we have build GridSearchCV which is used to get the best parameters for model building and for each moddel we have find out the metrics of mean_sqaured_error, root_mean_sqaured_error and r2_score.
Model which we have used is Linear Regression, Desicion Tree, Random FOrest, Gradient Bossting and XGBoosting Regressor model.
